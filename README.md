Notebooks of Leetcode Brushers! Code brushed in Python3.8 now!

**CAUTION**: Please install `nbdev` first!

## Strategies

- Brush the problems of the same kind together.
- Brush different kind of problems every day. One day one category.
- Brush each problem at least 3 times:
  - 1st time: check the answer if no ideas in 5 minutes.
  - 2nd time: check the answer if cannot solve independently in 30 minutes.
  - 3rd time: try to solve a problem in 15-20 minutes.
- Always and often check great answers from others in the 75-90 percentile run time.
  - Lower percentile answers might not be of high quality.
  - The most quick answer might contain too much weird tricks that is not universally useful.
- The most important categories are: searching, DP, graph, tree, binary search.
- Practice DP problems as much as you can.
  - It is not guaranteed that you can always successfully find a DP formula each time.
